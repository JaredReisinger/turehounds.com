# I'm trying to come up with a compact format for describing titles and
# definitions. I think an array or arrays (to avoid key boilerplate) will work:
# an array of "Events", where each event is a title prefix (if any?), name,
# description, and then a sub-array for individual titles:
#
#   [[KEY, Name, Description, [[TN, Title], [TA, Title], ...]], [KEY2, Name2,
#   ...]]
#
# where the [TN, Title] goes on to include:
#
#   [TN, Title, Description, PREFIX?, [SUPERCEDES, ...]]
#
# There are also some shortcuts... `^` in a title description means "use the
# event name" (so [CGCA, ^ Advanced] mean "Canine Good Citizen Advanced").
# Further, a second `^` means "use the default level suffix", where "N" means
# "Novice", and so on.
#
# By default, if the SUPERCEDES list is not present, a title supercedes anything
# before it in the event title list.
