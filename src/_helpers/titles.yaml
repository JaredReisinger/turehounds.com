# I'm trying to come up with a compact format for describing titles and
# definitions. I think an array or arrays (to avoid key boilerplate) will work:
# an array of "Events", where each event is a title prefix (if any?), name,
# description, and then a sub-array for individual titles:
#
#   [[KEY, Name, Description, DefaultTitle, [[TN, Title], [TA, Title], ...]], [KEY2, Name2,
#   ...]]
#
# where the [TN, Title] goes on to include:
#
#   [TN, Title, Description, [SUPERCEDES, ...], PREFIX?]
#
# There are also some shortcuts:
#    ^1 - use the default event title
#    ^2 - use the level that's the trailing letter of the title
#    ^A - (any letter) use the specified level
#    ^^ - shortcut for "^1 ^2"
#    ^  - shotcut for just "^1"
#
# By default, if the SUPERCEDES list is not present, a title supercedes anything
# before it in the event title list.
#
# UPDATE (2023-02-01): Maybe the lesser-used values (description, supercedes,
# prefix) should be in a keyed object? Like [TN, Title, {desc:, supercedes:...}]
# We're not actually using those fields yet, though, so :shrug:
