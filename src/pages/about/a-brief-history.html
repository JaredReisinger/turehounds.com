<p class="lead">
  Ture Hounds likely wouldn’t exist, but for a very special girl: our first
  Basenji, Disa.
</p>

<p>
  We came to Basenjis after having had a wonderful Papillon and an amazing
  retired racing Greyhound. We had long discussions about what we were looking
  for in our next dog(s), including physical activity, size,
  temperament/behavior, and so on. Winding our way through descriptions of the
  breeds we’d met, and those we hadn’t, we narrowed down to the hound group, and
  eventually centered on Basenjis. Digging deeper into the breed, we learned
  about the
  <a href="https://www.basenji.org/african/"
    >Basenji Club of America’s African Stock Project</a
  >, and we were determined to find a dog with a “high-quotient” African
  heritage, both for the qualities that we would enjoy directly, and for the
  potential benefit it could give back to the breed. The breeders in the greater
  Seattle area were fantastic about helping us find the progeny of recent
  imports, and we eventually found our way to Katie Campbell of Taji Basenjis
  and her (at the time) last-remaining and very independently-minded girl,
  “Know-neighm“.

<p>
  As is not uncommon when it comes to new four-legged members of the family,
  Know-neighm chose us even more than we did her, eventually hopping up on
  Barbara’s lap and letting the other dogs know all about it. A trial weekend
  became a full week, and before we knew it, we were thinking about names
  (ending on “Disa”) and getting ready to sign a purchase agreement. Part of the
  agreement—one that we fully expected given our desire for a more-African
  dog—was for her to be bred at least once. Finding a sire to pair with our
  special girl took a while, but with the help of Michael Work, a long-time
  principal in the breed, we finally found one in Bravo: a dog who no longer
  lived, but who had been collected some 25-odd years previously.
</p>

<p>
  The process of breeding, whelping, and raising the puppies also raised a very
  important question: would we want to do this again? With a resounding “yes!”,
  the next question was: should we have a kennel name? The answer to that was
  “yes” as well, leading to the process of finding a new name. After much
  research, we found what we thought was the perfect name, the Trickster in the
  lore of the Azande people: “Ture”.
