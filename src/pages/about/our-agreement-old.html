  For full transparency, here’s what our puppy agreement looks like, with some

      details.</aside>

  </ol>

  <h3>NAME</h3>

  <div class="p">
    The <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> will be AKC registered as “<var>REGISTERED NAME</var
    >”. The <abbr>PUPPY</abbr>’s call name (“<var>CALL NAME</var>”) was selected
    by the <abbr>BUYER</abbr> and that call name has been reported to and
    accepted by the <abbr>SELLER</abbr>.
    <aside>
      Included to show what we will register as the “official” registered name
      of the puppy.
    </aside>
  </div>

  <h3 id="akc-registration">AKC REGISTRATION</h3>

  <div class="p">
    The <abbr>BUYER</abbr> and <abbr>SELLER</abbr> agree that the AKC
    registration of the <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> will show four owners:
    <var>BUYER’S NAMES</var>, Barbara Reisinger, and Jared Reisinger, until
    other provisions in this agreement are met. Once met, the AKC registration
    will be transferred in accordance with said provisions.
    <aside class="text">
      A common question is “Why do you stay on as owners”? We do this as a “just
      in case” for things like the dog getting loose and picked up by animal
      control. Being listed as an owner means we can help get the dog back and
      returned to you.
    </aside>
  </div>

  <h3>DISPOSITION OR RELINQUISHMENT</h3>

  <div class="p">
    If the <abbr>BUYER</abbr> is unable or unwilling to reside with the
    <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> at <em><strong>any</strong></em> time during the
    <abbr>PUPPY</abbr>’s lifetime for <em><strong>any</strong></em> reason, the
    <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> will be returned to the <abbr>SELLER</abbr>, and the
    <abbr>BUYER</abbr> shall be entitled to $200.00, less any medical expenses,
    including a standard veterinary exam, incurred by the condition of the
    <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> upon her return.
    <aside>
      We guarantee that for the <em>entire</em> lifetime of the puppy, no matter
      what happens, we are responsible for its well-being. Life happens, and
      sometimes people can no longer care for a dog. We will find the dog a new
      home, no questions asked, and no judgment about the need to return it.
    </aside>
  </div>

  <div class="p">
    The <abbr>BUYER</abbr> agrees that the <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> shall not, under
    any circumstances, be placed in any humane agency, any commercial outlet for
    sale, given away or sold to a third party without the express written
    permission of the <abbr>SELLER</abbr>.
    <aside>
      We never, ever, <em><strong>ever</strong></em> want a puppy to be placed
      with an animal-rescue group. If the puppy is going to a new home, we want
      the opportunity to vet that home as well. If you have a family member that
      adores the dog and wants to adopt it, we will generally be okay with that.
    </aside>
  </div>

  <div class="p">
    The <abbr>SELLER</abbr> has interviewed and screened the
    <abbr>BUYER</abbr> to their satisfaction and has faith that the
    <abbr>BUYER</abbr> will provide a safe, loving, and forever home for the
    <abbr>PUPPY</abbr>. The <abbr>BUYER</abbr> agrees to take reasonable care of
    the <abbr>PUPPY</abbr>, and promptly to give or secure the best of attention
    to the physical welfare of the <abbr>PUPPY</abbr>, including appropriate
    inoculations and medical care. Should the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> determine at
    any time that reasonable care is not being taken and the physical welfare of
    the <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> is in jeopardy, the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> then acquires
    the right to physical possession of the <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> and her AKC
    registration certificate shall be signed over to <abbr>SELLER</abbr> as sole
    owner. Under these circumstances, the <abbr>BUYER</abbr> shall be entitled
    to one hundred ($100.00) dollars less any medical expenses incurred by the
    condition of the <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> upon her return to the
    <abbr>SELLER</abbr>. Following the physical acquisition of the
    <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> by the <abbr>SELLER</abbr>, the <abbr>BUYER</abbr> has
    the right to a third-party determination of the suitability of the
    <abbr>BUYER</abbr>’s living conditions and the physical condition of the
    <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> at the time of <abbr>SELLER</abbr>’s acquisition. The
    third party is to be agreed upon by the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> and the
    <abbr>BUYER</abbr> and shall be either an accredited veterinarian or an
    officer of a local dog club.
    <aside>
      We have <em><strong>never</strong></em> needed to exercise the “Should the
      <abbr>SELLER</abbr> determine at any time that reasonable care is not
      being taken and the physical welfare of the <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> is in
      jeopardy” clause. It exists because of situations that other breeders have
      encountered in the past. The entire purpose is to ensure the well-being of
      the puppy.
    </aside>
  </div>

  <h3>MEDICAL ASSURANCES</h3>

  <div class="p">
    The <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> is in good health, of sound mind and body and free
    from communicable diseases, as far as appears to the eye. The
    <abbr>BUYER</abbr> has had the opportunity to have the
    <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> examined by a veterinarian of their choice at their
    expense and to notify the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> of any illness or defect
    noted. As there have been no reports of any abnormality or deficiency, the
    <abbr>SELLER</abbr> and <abbr>BUYER</abbr> agree that the
    <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> was delivered in good health.
  </div>

  <div class="p">
    The full written vaccination and worming record will be provided to
    <abbr>BUYER</abbr> at the time of delivery.
  </div>

  <div class="p">
    FANCONI SYNDROME: The <abbr>SELLER</abbr> ascertains to have had the
    <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> direct-DNA-tested for Fanconi Syndrome by the University
    of Missouri-Columbia lab in association with the Orthopedic Foundation for
    Animals. The result of the Fanconi test is “<var>RESULT</var>”, which
    indicates that the <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> will <em><strong>not</strong></em> be
    affected by Fanconi Syndrome in later life.
    <aside>By virtue of our breeding choices, all puppies will be either “clear”
    or “carriers”; we should never have an “affected” puppy. See <a
    href="https://ofa.org/fanconi-syndrome/">OFA's Fanconi Syndrome page</a> for
    more details.</aside>
  </div>

  <div class="p">
    PROGRESSIVE RETINAL ATROPHY (PRA): The <abbr>SELLER</abbr> ascertains to
    have had the <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> direct-DNA-tested for the PRA-BJ1 form of
    Progressive Retinal Atrophy by the University of Missouri-Columbia lab in
    association with the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals. The result of the
    PRA-BJ1 test is “<var>RESULT</var>”, which indicates that the
    <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> will <em><strong>not</strong></em> be affected by PRA-BJ1
    in later life.
    <aside>By virtue of our breeding choices, all puppies should be “normal”; we
    should never have an “abnormal” puppy. See <a
    href="https://ofa.org/bansenji-pra/" target="_blank">OFA’s Basenji PRA
    page</a> for more details.</aside>
  </div>

  <div class="p">
    PERSISTENT PUPILLARY MEMBRANES (PPM): The <abbr>SELLER</abbr> ascertains to
    have had the <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> examined by a board certified canine
    ophthalmologist, <var>VETERINARIAN</var> on <var>DATE OF EXAM</var>. The
    test results are as follows: left and right eye: “<var>RESULT</var>”. These
    results enable the <abbr>PUPPY</abbr>’s eyes to be certified by Canine Eye
    Database monitored by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (“OFA”) and
    published in the quarterly report of the Basenji Club of America. A copy of
    this report will be furnished to the <abbr>BUYER</abbr> upon delivery.
    <aside>By virtue of our breeding choices, all puppies should be “normal”;
    there may be some small persistent membranes, but these typically disappear
    by the time the puppy reaches one year of age and do not impact their
    vision.</aside>
  </div>

  <div class="p">
    The <abbr>BUYER</abbr> acknowledges that he has been informed of the
    potential problems in the breed including FANCONI SYNDROME, PROGRESSIVE
    RETINAL ATROPHY (PRA), PERSISTENT PUPILLARY MEMBRANES (PPM), and HIP
    DYSPLASIA (HD). Should the <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> become affected with Fanconi
    Syndrome at any point in the <abbr>PUPPY</abbr>’s lifetime, or if PRA or HD
    develops before the age of ten years and is diagnosed by two completely
    independently-practicing veterinarians as being affected
    <em><strong>and</strong></em> the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> is still actively
    breeding Basenjis at the rate of one or more litters every two years, the
    <abbr>BUYER</abbr> is entitled to another puppy of the <abbr>SELLER</abbr>’s
    choice at no charge (shipping not to be included).
    <aside>
      We are very, very confident in the test results and our choice of dogs to
      breed. We have never needed to fulfill the “no-charge puppy” clause, but
      we absolutely will if we ever need to.
    </aside>
  </div>

  <h3>AGREE TO SPAY/NEUTER</h3>

  <div class="p">
    The <abbr>BUYER</abbr> agrees that the <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> shall be spayed
    after the age of one year or one estrus cycle, whichever comes first, and
    shall never whelp a litter. After the spay surgery, the <abbr>BUYER</abbr>
    will provide the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> with a copy of the <abbr>PUPPY</abbr>’s
    spay certificate (generated by the veterinary clinic) at which time the
    <abbr>SELLER</abbr> will change the AKC registration to reflect that the
    <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> is solely owned by the <abbr>BUYER</abbr>.
    <aside>Historically, breeders would require puppies to be spayed/neutered
    very, very young. There are developmental reasons why it’s better to wait
    for the puppy to grow a bit more first.</aside>
  </div>

  <h3>POTENTIAL BREEDING AND SHOWING</h3>

  <div class="p">
    The <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> will not be shown. Other than dog shows, the
    <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> is welcome and encouraged to pursue any/all other AKC
    events and venues such as lure coursing, rally, agility, tracking,
    obedience, “trick dog”, scentwork/nosework, etc. The <abbr>SELLER</abbr>
    will enthusiastically make introductions and open doors of opportunity for
    those should the <abbr>BUYER</abbr> indicate interest.
  </div>

  <h3>TRAINING</h3>

  <div class="p">
    The <abbr>SELLER</abbr> strongly recommends that the <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> be
    enrolled in a series of positive-reinforcement method group dog training
    sessions to learn and confirm basic manners including (but not limited to):
    basic house training, crate training so that the <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> is
    comfortable and clean in a crate in a home or in a car, leash training on a
    collar (not only on a harness), and the cues “sit”, “stand”, “wait”, “off”,
    and “come”.
  </div>

  <h3>COMMUNICATION</h3>

  <div class="p">
    The <abbr>BUYER</abbr> agrees to have contact with the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> a
    <em><strong>minimum</strong></em> of twice each calendar year (preferably
    before July 1st and December 1st)
    <em
      ><strong>for the lifetime of the <abbr>PUPPY</abbr></strong></em
    >, even after she is spayed, for the purposes of genetic charting. The rich
    pedigree information and knowledge that you enjoy with the
    <abbr>PUPPY</abbr> stems from the cooperation of former Taji buyers. Please
    continue the chain by contributing data for the benefit of future
    generations.
  </div>

  <h3>PUPPY SUPPORT—CUSTOMER SERVICE PROVIDED BY SELLER</h3>

  <div class="p">
    The <abbr>SELLER</abbr> assumes that the <abbr>BUYER</abbr> will need
    frequent counsel and coaching throughout the first year with the first
    couple of months being the most intense. The <abbr>SELLER</abbr> should
    always be the <abbr>BUYER</abbr>’s first resource and will be available to
    the <abbr>BUYER</abbr> as needed. The value of the <abbr>SELLER</abbr>’s
    time and sharing of their expertise is fully covered by the purchase price
    and remains available to the <abbr>BUYER</abbr> for The <abbr>PUPPY</abbr>’s
    entire lifetime.
    <aside>
      We have seen myriad times online where people with Basenjis ask questions
      which we feel should have been easily answered by their breeder. We
      <em>always</em> want to be available as your first, best resource for
      things like this.
