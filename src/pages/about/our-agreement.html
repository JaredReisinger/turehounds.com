  For full transparency, here’s what our puppy agreement looks like, with some
  annotations explaining why certain clauses are included. Note that the
  majority of the “burden” from the agreement is on us, not on the new puppy
  home.

    <abbr>THE SELLER</abbr> agrees to sell, and hereby does sell, and has this
    day delivered to the <abbr>BUYER</abbr>, a dog of Basenji breed and
    <var>MALE/FEMALE</var> sex, whelped on <var>DATE OF BIRTH</var> sired by
    <var>THE FATHER</var> (AKC registration <var>FATHER’S REGISTRATION
    NUMBER</var>) with the Dam being <var>THE MOTHER</var> (AKC registration
    <var>MOTHER’S REGISTRATION NUMBER</var>).  The dog is registered with AKC as
    <var>PUPPY’S REGISTERED NAME</var>, <var>PUPPY’S REGISTRATION NUMBER</var>,
    and is in good health, sound mind and body as verified by a veterinarian.
    <aside>

  <div class="p">
    THE CONSIDERATION for this sale is the sum of <var>PRICE</var>, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged; plus also the conditions to be performed by the <abbr>BUYER</abbr> as hereinafter set forth.
  </div>

  <ol>

    <li>
      The <abbr>BUYER</abbr> and the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> mutually agree upon two-week trial period, during which time the dog may be returned to the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> and the <abbr>BUYER</abbr> shall receive a full refund of the purchase price, less any medical expenses incurred by the condition of the dog upon his/her return.
    </li>

    <li class="lg:pb-30 xl:pb-30 2xl:pb-18">
      If the <abbr>BUYER</abbr> cannot keep the dog at any time during the dog’s lifetime, the dog will be returned to the <abbr>SELLER</abbr>.  The <abbr>BUYER</abbr> may not re-sell/re-home/transfer ownership of the dog without the <abbr>SELLER</abbr>’s permission.
      <aside>
        We guarantee that for the <em>entire</em> lifetime of the puppy, no matter what happens, we are responsible for its well-being. Life happens, and sometimes people can no longer care for a dog. We will find the dog a new home, no questions asked, and no judgment about the need to return it. We never, ever, <em><strong>ever</strong></em> want a puppy to be placed with an animal-rescue group. If the puppy is going to a new home, we want the opportunity to vet that home as well. If you have a family member that adores the dog and wants to adopt it, we will generally be okay with that.
      </aside>
    </li>

    <li>
      <abbr>BUYER</abbr> will notify <abbr>SELLER</abbr> of any changes of address occurring during the lifetime of the dog.
    </li>

    <li>
      <abbr>SELLER</abbr> will remain as co-owner of the dog. The American Kennel Club (AKC) registration original papers will remain in the <abbr>SELLER</abbr>’s possession; the <abbr>BUYER</abbr> will receive the official AKC Registration Certificate directly from the AKC.
      <aside>
        A common question is “Why do you stay on as owners”? We do this as a “just in case” for things like the dog getting loose and picked up by animal control. Being listed as an owner means we can help get the dog back and returned to you.
      </aside>
    </li>

    <li class="rounded bg-cyan-100">
      This dog is being sold as a show prospect.  The <abbr>BUYER</abbr> agrees to keep the dog intact and will not neuter/spay the dog without the <abbr>SELLER</abbr>’s written permission.  If the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> and <abbr>BUYER</abbr> agree at any time that the dog is not of show quality, #6-8 of this contract is voided, and <abbr>BUYER</abbr> will neuter/spay the dog at their cost.  If this occurs the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> agrees to sign off on co-ownership of the dog after proof of neutering/spaying has been provided to the <abbr>SELLER</abbr>.
      <aside>
        Items 5–8 only apply to puppies who are expected to show in conformation, and the details here assume that we would be doing the showing. These items may change depending on discussions with you and your plans for the puppy.
      </aside>
    </li>

    <li class="rounded bg-cyan-100">
      The <abbr>BUYER</abbr> agrees not to breed the dog without permission of the <abbr>SELLER</abbr>.  In the case of accidental mating, the <abbr>BUYER</abbr> is to pay the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> $5,000 in damages and the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> thereby acquires the right to physical possession of the dog.
    </li>

    <li class="rounded bg-cyan-100">
      With the understanding that the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> is the one who will show the dog, any dog show entry fees or other related dog show expenses will be paid by the <abbr>SELLER</abbr>.
      <aside>
        If we are the ones who want the puppy to be shown, we think it’s only fair that we bear the burden of the costs as well.
      </aside>
    </li>

    <li class="rounded bg-cyan-100">
      The <abbr>SELLER</abbr> plans to show the dog approximately 6 weekends per year until an AKC championship title is attained.  What to typically expect:

      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
        <li>
          The dog will need specific show training.  This can be accomplished by the <abbr>BUYER</abbr> attending class or practicing with guidance from the <abbr>SELLER</abbr>, or the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> can pick up the dog at a mutually agreed upon time to practice with the dog.  The amount of training needed will depend on the dog but may be approximately 6 number of times per year.
        </li>

        <li>
          If the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> would like to enter dog in a show, they will coordinate with the <abbr>BUYER</abbr> approximately 4–6 weeks prior to the show weekend.
        </li>

        <li>
          If the show weekend works for the <abbr>BUYER</abbr>’s schedule, the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> will enter the dog in the show.
        </li>

        <li>
          The <abbr>BUYER</abbr> and <abbr>SELLER</abbr> will coordinate whether the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> picks up and drops off the dog for the show weekend, or if the <abbr>BUYER</abbr> would like to transport (and cheer on!) the dog to and from the show.
        </li>

        <li>
          The <abbr>SELLER</abbr> encourages any interest or involvement in dog sports by the BUYER!
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      The <abbr>BUYER</abbr> agrees to take good care of this dog, feed and house the dog properly (indoors), maintain inoculations and medical care at the <abbr>BUYER</abbr>’s expense.  The <abbr>BUYER</abbr> agrees to control the dog on a leash when in public and when off the premises of the dog’s home.  The <abbr>BUYER</abbr> agrees that the dog’s outdoor area will be fenced-in and secure, or provision will be made to assure the dog is safe any time it is outdoors.  The <abbr>BUYER</abbr> agrees to give the dog proper physical and emotional care and welfare.  The <abbr>BUYER</abbr> agrees to house the dog indoors as its primary housing.  Should the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> determine at any time that good care is NOT being taken and that the physical welfare of the dog is in jeopardy, the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> thereby acquires the right to physical possession of the dog.  Following the physical acquisition of the dog by the <abbr>SELLER</abbr>, the <abbr>BUYER</abbr> has the right to a third-party determination of the suitability of the <abbr>BUYER</abbr>’s living conditions and the physical condition of the dog at the time of reacquisition.  The third party is to be agreed upon by the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> and <abbr>BUYER</abbr>, and shall be either an accredited veterinarian or an officer of a local all-breed kennel club.
      <aside>
        We have <em><strong>never</strong></em> needed to exercise the “Should the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> determine at any time that good care is NOT being taken and that the physical welfare of the dog is in jeopardy” clause. It exists because of situations that other breeders have encountered in the past. The entire purpose is to ensure the well-being of the puppy. And, to protect you against overreach on our part, we will let an impartial third-party make the final judgement.
      </aside>
    </li>

    <li>
      The <abbr>BUYER</abbr> agrees to consult with the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> on the dog’s vaccines for the dog’s life for optimum health.  The <abbr>SELLER</abbr> follows a conservative vaccine protocol recommended by Integrative Vet Med Center, Phoenix, AZ.
    </li>

    <li>
      The <abbr>BUYER</abbr> agrees that while this dog resides with the <abbr>BUYER</abbr>, the <abbr>SELLER</abbr> shall not be financially responsible for any and all actions of this dog.
    </li>
</ol>
