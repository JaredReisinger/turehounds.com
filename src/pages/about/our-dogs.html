<p>
  We think our dogs are pretty terrific, and what they’ve achieved says a lot
  about what we expect for any of our dogs, whether “show” or “companion”.

    A half-African out of a mother who was brought out of the Congo as a puppy
    (Avongara Naziki) and a domesticated father (Penda Taji’s Tri-Umphant One),
    Disa is a prime example of the uncommon “open cap” coloration pattern.
  </p>
  <p>
    She is a natural hunter, finding great success in both lure-coursing—she’s
    earned her Field Championship, which is implied in the “DC” title—and in
    Barn Hunt—the “RATM”. Disa also enjoys “working” just for the sake of work,
    and spending time with us, be it working on tricks (“TKA”) or on flyball
    (“FDX”). Yes, that’s right, Basenjis can play flyball! (If you’re patient,
    anyway.)

  <p>
    Technically a half-African, but what we’d prefer to call “two-quarters
    African” because of an additional generation of breeding, Spyros is out of
    two half-African parents: mother Possum Creek’s Ngoma and father Kibushi The
    Oracle (a.k.a. “Wags”). Spyros shows a much-more-typical tri-color pattern
    but is distinguished by having very little white, with no flashy white
    “collar” around his neck.
  </p>
  <p>
    Spyros loves to run and chase, happily volunteering to test lure-coursing
    layouts, run in the singles stakes, and in coursing ability tests, all on
    the same day. As long as the “bunny” is moving, he’s after it! He also truly
    loves “working” when there’s a chance for treats at the end.

    Our “keeper” out of Disa’s first litter (sired by the famous Sonbar’s
    Celestial Wizard, a.k.a. “Bravo”), Gable is a spunky little monkey. Having
    been raised from birth using the “Puppy Culture” protocol, he believes that
    the world is a fun place, where new experiences can be incredibly rewarding…
    which means he’s willing to try doing just about anything! (If we could get
    a Basenji to swim voluntarily, it would most likely be Gable.)
