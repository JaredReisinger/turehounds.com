        A half-African out of a mother who was brought out of the Congo as a
        puppy (Avongara Naziki) and a domesticated father (Penda Taji’s
        Tri-Umphant One), Disa is a prime example of the uncommon “open cap”
        coloration pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        She is a natural hunter, finding great success in both
        lure-coursing—she’s earned her Field Championship, which is implied in
        the “DC” title—and in Barn Hunt—the “RATM”. Disa also enjoys “working”
        just for the sake of work, and spending time with us, be it working on
        tricks (“TKA”) or on flyball (“FDX”). Yes, that’s right, Basenjis can
        play flyball! (If you’re patient, anyway.)

        Technically a half-African, but what we’d prefer to call “two-quarters
        African” because of an additional generation of breeding, Spyros is out
        of two half-African parents: mother Possum Creek’s Ngoma and father
        Kibushi The Oracle (a.k.a. “Wags”). Spyros shows a much-more-typical
        tri-color pattern but is distinguished by having very little white, with
        no flashy white “collar” around his neck.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spyros loves to run and chase, happily volunteering to test
        lure-coursing layouts, run in the singles stakes, and in coursing
        ability tests, all on the same day. As long as the “bunny” is moving,
        he’s after it! He also truly loves “working” when there’s a chance for
        treats at the end.

        Our “keeper” out of Disa’s first litter (sired by the famous Sonbar’s
        Celestial Wizard, a.k.a. “Bravo”), Gable is a spunky little monkey.
        Having been raised from birth using the “Puppy Culture” protocol, he
        believes that the world is a fun place, where new experiences can be
        incredibly rewarding… which means he’s willing to try doing just about
        anything! (If we could get a Basenji to swim voluntarily, it would most
        likely be Gable.)

        In the conformation and performance dog world, we sometimes call this
        the “alphabet soup”, because it looks like a bunch of random gibberish.
        In truth, it’s simply the way that AKC and other organizations indicate
        any titles earned by the dog.
      </p>

      <p>Here’s a quick guide to the ones you might see on this page:</p>

      <table class="table-default">
        <tbody>
          {% for title in titleList %}
            {% set titleInfo = titleMap[title] %}
            <tr>
              <td class="whitespace-nowrap">{{ title }}</td>
              <td>
                {{ titleInfo.name -}}
                {%- if titleInfo.desc %} ({{ titleInfo.desc }}){% endif %}
              </td>
              <td>{{ titleInfo.event[1] }}</td>
            </tr>
          {% endfor %}
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p class="text-zinc-400">
        <i
          >(There are more listed on the
          <a href="/titles/">titles</a> page.)</i
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        So, you would interpret Disa’s titles (<b>DC</b> /
        <b>SC CA BCAT CGCA CGCU TKA FDX RATM</b>) as:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc">
        <li>Dual Champion <i>(both conformation and performance)</i></li>
        <li>Senior Courser</li>

        <li>Canine Good Citizen Advanced</li>
        <li>Canine Good Citizen Urban</li>
        <li>Trick Dog Advanced</li>
        <li>Flyball Dog Excellent</li>
        <li>Barn Hunt Master</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        ... and Spyros’s titles (<b>CH</b> /
        <b>RN JC CAA BCAT SWA RATO CGCA CGCU TKP</b>) as:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc">
