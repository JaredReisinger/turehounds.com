  <p>
    Having grown up on a ranch, and still having ties to one, Barbara is no
    stranger to breeding and raising animals. She is the mastermind behind any
    breedings at Ture Hounds, carefully choosing a sire and dam whose attributes
    will complement each other.

  {% call bioCard("Jared Reisinger", "jared-and-disa.jpg") %}
  <p>
    Having grown up in the wilds of suburbia, Jared is
    <em>not</em>
    the breeding mastermind. His primary role is to help raise the puppies,
    ensuring they, and he, have a lot of fun and silliness.
