    <h2>Do you have puppies?</h2>
    <p>
      Unless you’ve seen otherwise, or have talked with us directly, the answer
      is probably “not at the moment.” A girl basenji only comes into season
      once a year, typically in the fall. If she’s bred, the puppies will be
      born close to the turn of the year and will get to meet their new families
      after about 3 months (end of March/beginning of April). If you’re
      interested, please
      <a href="/puppy-interest-questionnaire/"
        >fill out the puppy interest questionnaire</a
      >
      and we can start a discussion about what you’re looking for.

      <b>Please note:</b> We have no specific breeding plans for
      2023/2024. We are always happy to start discussions with you about what
      you are looking for, but please be aware that you’ll likely need to wait a
      couple of years.

    <h2>Can I choose my puppy?</h2>
    <p>
      Our best answer for this is “we will help match you to a puppy that meets
      what you’re looking for”. The process of matching a puppy with a family
      usually (and should!) involve a fair bit of discussion about your
      home-life, what kinds of things you want to do with a new dog—conformation
      (“showing”), sports, hiking, and so on. Given a typical litter of five
      puppies, one or two may be kept or given to another breeder, leaving only
      three to be placed with new families. Our preference is to match on
      personality first, then sex, and then (and only then) color.

    <h2>Can I get a puppy at/before 8 weeks?</h2>
    <p>
      They are incredibly cute, but there are some important developmental
      milestones that happen between 8-12 weeks of age, including a “fear
      period”. We spend that time making sure the puppies are as “socialized” as
      possible while watching out to ensure that they aren’t pushed too hard
      during a fear period. A common misconception is that you’ll miss out on
      “bonding” time, but as the primary person in their life—once you’re in
      their life, of course—you will absolutely develop a strong bond. We didn’t
      have Disa until she was 8 months old, and yet she’s as strongly bonded to
      us—and us to her!—as Spyros, who arrived around 12 weeks, and as Gable,
      who we’ve had since birth!
    </p>
    <p>
      We would encourage you to come and visit the puppies if at all possible,
      though, so that you can see them as they develop, and so that you get to
      know them even if they can’t go home with you yet.

    <h2>How much is a puppy?</h2>
    <p>
      To be absolutely honest, if this is one of the first questions you have,
      the odds are that you’re not the kind of home we’re looking for. At the
      same time, it’s a fair question since some “designer” breeds are sold in
      the neighborhood of $5,000 or more! When it comes down to it, a good,
      reputable, and respectable breeder isn’t breeding dogs in order to make
      money, because they aren’t in the business of selling dogs, they’re in the
      “business” of trying to breed their ideal dog. To that extent, we place
      puppies “at cost”, based on the cost of whelping, rearing, and
      health-testing; this isn’t a money-making venture. (And if you want a
      ballpark, it’s roughly less than one-third of the “designer” amount
      mentioned previously.)

  <div class="mb-12 break-inside-avoid-column">
    <h2>Can I name my puppy?</h2>
    <p>
      For the most part, yes! We were particular about naming Disa and Spyros,
      so we fully understand wanting to choose a name that “fits”. Since all of
      our puppies are registered with the AKC, we will work with you to find a
      registered name that reflects the day-in/day-out “call name” you end up
      choosing. For example,
      <a href="/previous-litters/2017/banjo-mr-red/">Banjo</a>,
      <a href="/previous-litters/2017/delilah-miss-yellow">Delilah</a> and
      <a href="/previous-litters/2017/cowboy-mr-green">Cowboy</a> were all named
      by their new families, and we came up with AKC registered names that
      reflect those names. (We kept
      <a href="/previous-litters/2017/dresden-mr-blue">Dresden</a> and
      <a href="/previous-litters/2017/gable-mr-white">Gable</a> long enough that
      we chose their names, but the same process applied.)

    <h2>How soon can the puppy be spayed/neutered?</h2>
    <p>
      Although it was common once upon a time to “fix” dogs anywhere from the
      time that they were placed in new families to 6-9 months, of age, current
      research in dogs’ physical development suggests that it’s much better to
      wait until they are roughly 2 years old. There are some significant and
      crucial growth stages that occur as dogs mature, and we believe that the
      benefits to the dog’s well-being outweigh the inconvenience of owning an
      “intact” dog for a couple of years. There is never a “one-size-fits-all”
      answer, though, so make sure to talk with us if you have any particular
      concerns or circumstances.

    <h2>Where can I find out more about Basenjis?</h2>
    <p>
      The Basenji Club of America (BCOA) has
      <a href="https://basenji.org/index.php/about-basenjis"
        >an incredible amount of information about the breed</a
      >, including history, health information, and their “Basenji University”
      for new and future Basenji families.
