    On July 16, 2017, our first litter arrived! All of these puppies now have
    their forever-homes, and we couldn’t be happier with their new families.

  <p>
    Finding a sire to pair with our first Basenji, Disa, took a while, but with
    the help of Michael Work, a long-time principal in the breed, we finally
    found one in {{ dogName("Sonbar’s Celestial Wizard", "Bravo", "CH") }}: a
    dog who no longer lived, but who had been collected some 25-odd years
    previously. Using semen of that age meant a lot of advance testing to help
    ensure that everything was as ideal as possible for the artificial
    insemination’s success. Not only was it successful, but each and every one
    of the puppies has been wonderfully healthy.

      Banjo, the second born, was the high-jumper of the litter. He was the
      motivating factor in all four of our puppy-pen upgrades, needing
      climb-proofing and jump-proofing well before any of his siblings.

      The middle child, and only girl, Miss Delilah very clearly grew up with
      four brothers, learning to give as good as she got.

      Our initial “keeper” out of Disa’s first litter{# (sired by the famous
      Sonbar’s Celestial Wizard, a.k.a. “Bravo”)#}, Gable is a spunky little
      monkey. Having been raised from birth using the “Puppy Culture” protocol,
      he believes that the world is a fun place, where new experiences can be
      incredibly rewarding… which means he’s willing to try doing just about
      anything! (If we could get a Basenji to swim voluntarily, it would most
      likely be Gable.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Gable is now the “brother from another mother” for the lovely Odette, and
      aiming to become a Hollywood star.

      Last but certainly not least, Cowboy loved to play with all of his
      brothers and his sister.
