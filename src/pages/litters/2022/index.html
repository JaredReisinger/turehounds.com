    Our third litter was a co-breeding with Jon Curby <i>(Kibushi)</i> out of a
    daughter of Spyros,
    {{ dogName("Possum Creek’s Cadillac Style With Spring Willow", "Caddie") }},
    and sired by {{ dogName("Suaralayn Royal First Flush", "Finlay") }}. Caddie
    lives with our good friend and one of Spyros’s co-breeders, Carole Kirk, so
    the litter was whelped and raised by her.
