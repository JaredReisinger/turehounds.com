    We are very excited to share that we have a litter planned for the fall of
    2024, out of our “remote keeper” from Disa’s second litter,
    {{ dogName("Ture’s Sending Sirius Signals", "Hedy", "GCHB", "TKN") }}, and
    sired by
    {{ dogName("Saorsa FoPaw’s Warp Factor Won", "Gage", "SBIF GCH DC", "SC CA BCAT TKA SGRC VBX") -}}
    .
  </p>

  <p>
    This litter is a co-breeding with our very good friend Andrea Stone of
    <a href="https://saorsabasenjis.wixsite.com/basenjis">Saorsa Basenjis</a>,
    and she has
    <a href="https://saorsabasenjis.wixsite.com/basenjis/projects-6"
      >a fantastic write-up on what we expect from the litter</a
    >:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      It will be a co-breeding with our good friends Barbara &amp; Jared of Ture
      Basenjis, and blends the “old” so-called domestic and the “new” African
      pedigrees in what we hope will be beautifully tempered dogs that exude
      “Basenji-ness”, and are up for whatever activity you want to try. The
      parents will be
      {{ dogName("Saorsa FoPaw’s Warp Factor Won", "Gage", "SBIF GCH DC", "SC CA BCAT TKA SGRC VBX") }}
      and {{ dogName("Ture’s Sending Sirius Signals", "Hedy", "GCHB", "TKN") }}.
    </p>

    <p>
      This combo will result in puppies who will not have Fanconi Syndrome, and
      though they could possibly carry one copy of the gene that causes
      PRA-Night Blindness, they will never actually have it. Dogs must have two
      copies to be affected by the disease.
    </p>

    <p>
      Puppies are expected to be red and tri colored, and though this is a
      complete outcross, we expect fun, engaged temperaments, beautiful heads,
      rich coats, level toplines, and beautiful Basenji movement. We also expect
      them to have lots of potential in various sports, including racing, lure
      coursing, scent work (Gage is in classes now), or whatever else you might
      like to try. Mostly, they should be fun little dogs.
    </p>

    <p>
      These puppies will be ⅛ recent African import, which is not a lot, but it
      is my hope that this will help promote some heterozygosity important to
      immune health, but maintain the breed type we desire.
