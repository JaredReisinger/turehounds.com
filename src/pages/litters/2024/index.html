    We are very excited to share that we have a litter planned for the fall of
    2024, out of our “remote keeper” from Disa’s second litter,
    {{ dogName("Ture’s Sending Sirius Signals", "Hedy", "GCHB", "TKN") }}, and
    sired by
    {{ dogName("Saorsa FoPaw’s Warp Factor Won", "Gage", "SBIF GCH DC", "SC CA BCAT TKA SGRC VBX") -}}
    .

    This litter is a co-breeding with our very good friend Andrea Stone of
    <a href="https://saorsabasenjis.wixsite.com/basenjis">Saorsa Basenjis</a>,
    and she has
    <a href="https://saorsabasenjis.wixsite.com/basenjis/projects-6"
      >a fantastic write-up on what we expect from the litter</a
    >.
