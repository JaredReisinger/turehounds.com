  <p class="lead">We currently have one adult available for placement.</p>

  <p>
    Dresden, from our <a href="/litters/2017/">first litter</a>, is looking for
    a forever home through absolutely no fault of his own… his previous home had
    a change of circumstance—one of the couple requires hospice, and caring for
    a dog is now just too much for them to handle.
  </p>

  {% call bioCard(dogName("Ture & Taji’s Sirius Piece Of Work", "Dresden", "CH"), "src/pages/litters/2017/gallery/dresden-group1.jpg") %}
  <p>
    First-born Dresden was the fantastic older-by-minutes-brother to the rest of
    the litter. He stayed with us longer than any other puppy (except for Gable)
    until he headed out east for conformation fame.

  {% endcall %}

  <p>Dresden:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>will be 7-years-old on July 16, 2024</li>
    <li>is a neutered red &amp; white male</li>
    <li>
      is a conformation champion, and has won Group 1 (if you know, you know)
    </li>
    <li>is <em>wonderfully</em> sweet</li>
    <li>loves to play</li>
    <li>travels fantastically in a kennel</li>
    <li>
      is up-to-date on all of the vaccinations that we require, and his
      <a href="https://ofa.org/advanced-search/?appnum=1904168"
        >health-testing results are available on OFA</a
      >
    </li>
    <li>walks beautifully on lead... unless a bunny or lizard runs by!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    He has become accustomed to being an only dog, so we are
    <em><strong>only</strong></em> considering homes in which this will be the
    case. He is good with children as long as they are respectful of his
    space—typical of Basenjis. He does not currently enjoy being kenneled at
    home, which we suspect is because he simply hasn’t had to. That said, we’ve
    been able to leave him loose and unsupervised for 3 hours, and he just curls
    up and naps; an advantage to his <em>not</em> being a puppy.
