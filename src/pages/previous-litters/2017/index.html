  On July 16, 2017, our first litter arrived! All of these puppies now have
  their forever-homes, and we couldn’t be happier with their new families.

  Finding a sire to pair with our first Basenji, Disa, took a while, but with
  the help of Michael Work, a long-time principal in the breed, we finally found
  one in Bravo: a dog who no longer lived, but who had been collected some
  25-odd years previously. Using semen of that age meant a lot of advance
  testing to help ensure that everything was as ideal as possible for the
  artificial insemination’s success. Not only was it successful, but each and
  every one of the puppies has been wonderfully healthy.
