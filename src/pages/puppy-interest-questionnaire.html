<p>
  We receive a lot of inquiries, most of the “do you have puppies?” variety.
  (More about which,
  <a href="/frequently-asked-questions/">please see the FAQs</a>.) To jump-start
  the conversation, we have some questions for you to answer (or to ponder)
  first. It should take a good 20-30 minutes to complete, and all questions
  require answers.

  <b>Please note:</b> We have no specific breeding plans for 2023/2024. We are
  always happy to start discussions with you about what you are looking for, but
  please be aware that you’ll likely need to wait a couple of years.

        either. Five thousand years of instinct cannot be curbed easily. Being
        struck by an automobile is one of the most common causes of death or
        injury for a Basenji.</span
